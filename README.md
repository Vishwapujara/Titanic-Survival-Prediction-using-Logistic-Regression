# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the survival probability of passengers aboard the Titanic using a logistic regression model.
The project leverages two datasets, namely the training set and the test set, to train and evaluate the model's performance.
The project is developed using Python and relies on popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.
